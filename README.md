This project contains various mini-apps and small libraries written in Lisp. 

It has been created for educational purposes only, i.e. as a measure of my progress in learning this language.

Note: for running the tests you need to download the lisp-unit framework from https://github.com/OdonataResearchLLC/lisp-unit. The root directory of this repo should be pulled into the same parent directory as the LearnLisp project. Run the tests by executing exectests.lisp from the LearnLisp/Tests directory. For more information please read the documentation contained in the lisp-unit repo.
